#  Git Introduction


Git can be hard to navigate. This page has been created to help HI members to utilize good git practices to prevent extraneous merge conflicts and allow more seamless work on the PCB boards. This page does not include information on how to connect GitHub to CadLab. For this there will be a separate page that is linked on the side.


# Git Commands To Use
Included below is a table of git commands to leverage. It will be a great reference and tool to be able to use not only for Solar Car but also for any future endeavours. Please bookmark this.

Utilizing good git practices is monumental in allowing for the team to work efficiently. It may seem like a lot but it will become more easy with practice. Below there is a link graciously provided by an Software Development Essentials textbook spearheaded by Professor McBurney from UVA. Please read the link in its entirety to be most prepared for PCB designs.
