# Software and the Steps to Set it Up
This section talks about the software needed to be successful and an integral member of the HI subteam. We will also explore how to set-up repositories from CadLab on your remote desktop.

## Visual Studio Code
One important piece of software we recommend downloading is Visual Studio Code. The website to download Visual Studio Code is linked below.

When downloading the software, make sure to choose the configuration that works best for your devivce. Once downloaded, make sure to click on the package and install it and open onto your laptop. For the purpose of HI team, you will not be needing to connect to a remote SSH. However for other classes at UVA especially in the CS department, it is strongly recommended that you install the SSH for those classes into Visual Studio Code. 

Visual Studio Code will provide an avenue to handle all git for the CadLab repository. It also allows for you to see the raw breakdown of the files that are edited in KiCad. Visual Studio Code will also act as an avenue to handle any merge conflicts that arise when updating the branches. To avoid this as much as possible, make sure to pull any new changes onto your branch and make sure the submodule is updated to the most recent version. More information on this will be included on the Git practices subpage. 

## Git
**Git set-up in terminal**

Before you can utilize the beauty of CadLab and KiCad, you must link your GitHub account to a CadLab account. The steps are stated below.

### Github to CadLab Connection


After all of these steps have been completed, you are ready to start exploring CadLab and KiCad.

## Cadlab
Before we getted started on CadLab features, make sure your github and cadlab account are linked as seen above. Thie sill the only way that you will be able to work in the Solar Car CadLab repository. Once these two are linked, go ahead and reach out to the HI lead for next steps and permission to join the repository. Once you have access, make sure to bookmark the page since it will be accessed fairly often. 

**CadLab downloading**

For the next couple steps, make sure to have CadLab and Git installed on your local device. First you would go into the Solar Car CadLab repository and access the specific directory. For the 2024-2025 academic, please access

## KiCad
Once CadLab has been set-up and the files from the repository are pulled to your local device, make sure to have a folder structure to be able to organize all the files you will be needing to keep track of in Solar Car. It is better to set this up earlier than later to maintain the maximum efficiency.
