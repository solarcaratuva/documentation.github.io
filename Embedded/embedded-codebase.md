# Embedded Codebase

The Embedded Codebase is the code that is compiled and uploaded to the Solar Car. This is the subteam's primary project every year. There is a separate codebase for each design cycle, each of which are linked below. 

For guidance on compiling, uploading, monitoring and other development information, see the `README` of the respective design cycle's codebase.
